Building requires moving glew32.dll and glfw3.dll into system32 folder

https://www.glfw.org/download
https://glew.sourceforge.net/install.html

I started this project last summer and have been moving at a snail's pace mostly due to wanted to be as puritan as possible while diving into completely new territory, which over and over again has burnt me out. This project lacks const-correctness because it is mostly meant to teach me about the rendering pipeline and OpenGL, not C++. I haven't added much documentation as of 8/14/24 but hopefully as time goes on I reorganize this project into something I can be more proud of (and maybe fix the const-correctness someday).
